"The News We Kept To Ourselves." _New York Times,_ April 11, 2003.  {{< br >}}The press can be cowed into practicing self-censorship.

"Save Our Spooks." _New York Times_, May 30, 2003.  {{< br >}}Governments misperceive the world if their intelligence agencies misreport foreign realities.

"Foreign Policy's Big Moment." _New York Times_, April 11, 1999, pp. 4, 17.  {{< br >}}Claimed here: during political campaigns U.S. politicians pander to U.S. voters by framing dangerous foreign policy positions that they cannot abandon once in office. The country is thereby led into folly. A corollary: a prime threat to America is ... an American public that responds well to irresponsible pandering.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Janis, Irving.

"Bush to Formalize A Defense Policy of Hitting First." _New York Times_, June 17, 2002.  {{< br >}}The Bush Administration has embraced a general doctrine of preventive war against rogue states that aspire to develop weapons of mass destruction.

| 4 | The War on Terror  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Other National Security Policy Issues | "The Uranium Underground." _Time_, December 17, 2001, pp. 40-45.  {{< br >}}Vast amounts of nuclear materials are swishing around the former Soviet Union unguarded—enough to build tens of thousands of atomic bombs. Washington doesn't seem to care much. (This article is 2.7 years old but sadly little has changed). Is this stupid or what? Duck and cover!  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Benjamin, Daniel, and Steven Simon. _The Age of Sacred Terror._ 2nd ed. NY: Random House, 2003, pp. 38-55, 61-68, 91-94, 419-489.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Pages 38-55, 62-68, 91-94 describe the Islamist currents of thinking that spawned Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda's violence stems from a stream of Islamist thought going back to ibn Taymiyya, a bellicose Islamic thinker from the 13th century; to Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792), the harsh and rigid shaper of modern Saudi Arabian Islam; to Rashid Rida (1866-1935) and Hassan al-Banna (?-1949); and above all to Sayyid Qutb (?-1966), the shaper of modern Islamism. Taymiyya, al-Wahhab and Qutb are covered here. Covered also (pp. 91-94) is the frightening rise of apocalyptic thinking in the Islamic world. What causes the murderous thinking described here?  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Pages 419-446 is a terrifying survey of the rise of nihilistic madness in a number of the world's great religions. Isn't the millennialist thinking described here likely at some point to lead believers in these views to use weapons of mass destruction on cities? What should the U.S. do about this threat??  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Pages 447-489 surveys and evaluates Bush administration counter-terror strategies.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Not assigned but also valuable are pp. 219-393, a survey of Clinton administration counter-terror strategies and policies. They are recommended.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Chyba, Christopher F. "Toward Biological Security." _Foreign Affairs_ 81, no. 3 (May/June 2002): 122-137.  {{< br >}}The danger posed by biological weapons in terrorist hands may be even scarier than the danger of nuclear weapons.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Flynn, Stephen. "The Neglected Home Front." _Foreign Affairs_ 83, no. 5 (September/October 2004): 20-33.  {{< br >}}The U.S. is alarmingly vulnerable to terrorist attack. The door is wide open. We are sitting ducks.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Chait, Jonathan. "The 9/10 President." _New Republic_, March 10, 2003, pp. 18-23.  {{< br >}}The Bush Administration is neglecting homeland security.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Blumenthal, Ralph. "Getting the Intelligence Services a Vulnerable Nation Needs." _New York Times_, September 8, 2002.  {{< br >}}Intelligence and counter terror experts are here interviewed on U.S. counter-terror intelligence needs. Their answers indicate that:  {{< br >}}1) the U.S. still needs to centralize command of U.S. intelligence functions (Turner) and to centralized assessment of intelligence data (Treverton, Oakley);  {{< br >}}2) the U.S. still needs to separate domestic counter terror functions from law enforcement functions—in other words, to create an American MI-5 (Smith, Schulhofer);  {{< br >}}3) the U.S. has not adequately moved to train local law enforcement in counter terror functions or to develop local counter terror units (Kallstrom);  {{< br >}}4) U.S. borders remain wide open. These weaknesses remain in 2004. What accounts for such appalling lassitude by the U.S. government? Earth to Washington: it's time for action!  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Allison, Graham. "How to Stop Nuclear Terror." _Foreign Affairs_ 83, no. 1 (January/February 2004): 64-74.  {{< br >}}A plan for action to prevent a disaster that we better prevent! (We will return to this subject in the last class period.)  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}"Nuclear Breakout." _New York Times_, July 27, 2003. And  {{< br >}}"Curb the Spread of Nuclear Arms." _New York Times_, July 29, 2003. (letters)  {{< br >}}A snippet arguing that to halt nuclear proliferation the world must strengthen the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Today that treaty doesn't even ban the enrichment of uranium or reprocessing of plutonium, the two basic methods of making nuclear bombs. Let's do something about it! And letters in reaction.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}The advance of science has a fearsome by product: we are discovering ever more powerful means of destruction. These destructive powers are being democratized: the mayhem that only major states can do today may lie within the capacity of millions of individuals in the future unless we somehow change course. Deterrence works against states but will fail against crazed non-state organizations or individuals. How can the spread of destructive powers be controlled?  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}We will return to this subject in the last class period in December.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}For more on controlling the longterm bioweapons danger see: [The Controlling Dangerous Pathogens Project](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277060332_Controlling_Dangerous_Pathogens_Project_Regional_Workshop_on_Dual-Use_Research_Meeting_Report). |
